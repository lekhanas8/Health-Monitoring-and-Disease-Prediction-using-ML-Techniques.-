The process of manipulating and extracting implicit, known or previously unknown, and possibly 
relevant information from data is known as machine learning. The use and scope of machine 
learning are always growing, making it a broad and varied area. It includes a range of ensemble 
learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning classifiers that are used to forecast and 
assess the correctness of given datasets. This information can be used to assist a huge population 
in programs like HDPS. Cardiovascular diseases are a broad category of heart-related ailments 
that are common in modern culture. 
The goal is to determine a patient's likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of cardiovascular heart 
disease based on characteristics like age, gender, chest discomfort, fasting blood sugar, etc. The 
project determines if a patient may have cardiac illness by using a dataset from the UCI repository 
that includes patient medical history and features. Four algorithms Random Forest Classifier, 
KNN, ANN, and Logistic Regression are used to train the 14 medical characteristics. Random 
Forest is the most effective of these, obtaining recall of 94%. Lastly, a cost-effective technique is 
demonstrated for classifying people at risk of heart disease. 
Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) account for 17.9 million deaths worldwide, according to the 
World Health Organization, making it the top cause of adult mortality. Our goal is to use a patient's 
medical history to forecast who is most likely to receive a heart disease diagnosis. It helps diagnose 
diseases with fewer medical tests and more effective treatments by recognizing symptoms like 
high blood pressure or chest pain, which contributes to prompt and focused care. Four main 
data mining techniques are the subject of this project: Random Forest Classifier, KNN, Logistic 
Regression and ANN. The project outperforms earlier systems that only use one data mining 
technique, with an accuracy of 87.5%. This project includes the supervised learning technique of 
logistic regression, which works with discrete values. ML models can be tailored for personalized 
medicine, offering recommendations based on an individualâ€™s genetic profile, lifestyle, and 
medical history.
